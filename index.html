  <h1>Privacy Policy for Video to MP3 Browser Extension</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> March 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:n1katuuun@gmail.com">n1katuuun@gmail.com</a></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Thank you for choosing the Video to MP3 browser extension ("Extension"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Extension.</p>
  <p>By installing and using the Extension, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Our Extension is designed with privacy as a priority. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user information. Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not require registration, login, or any personal details to use the Extension.</li>
    <li><strong>No Tracking or Analytics:</strong> We do not use cookies, analytics, or tracking technologies.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All video-to-audio conversions occur locally within your browser. Your files never leave your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How the Extension Works</h2>
  <p>The Extension converts video files to MP3 audio format directly within your browser using the Web Audio API and MediaRecorder API. The conversion process is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You select or drag-and-drop a video file into the Extension interface.</li>
    <li>The Extension processes the video locally in your browser.</li>
    <li>The audio stream is extracted and converted to MP3 format locally.</li>
    <li>The resulting MP3 file is provided to you for download directly from your browser.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>At no point during this process are your files uploaded to any external servers or third-party services.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> The Extension temporarily stores files and conversion data in your browser's local memory during the conversion process. Once the conversion is complete and the file is downloaded, temporary data is automatically cleared.</li>
    <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> Since no data leaves your device, your files remain secure and private. We implement industry-standard security practices to ensure the Extension operates safely within your browser environment.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
  <p>Our Extension does not integrate with or rely on any third-party services. However, please note:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Extension may be installed via third-party browser extension stores (e.g., Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons). These platforms have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them separately.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. YouTube and Third-Party Content Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>The Extension is a general-purpose tool designed to convert video files that you legally own or have explicit permission to use. While our Extension description may reference "YouTube to MP3" as a general example of functionality, we explicitly state the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Compliance with Terms of Service:</strong> Downloading or converting copyrighted content from YouTube or other platforms without explicit permission from the copyright holder is strictly prohibited and may violate applicable laws and platform terms of service.</li>
    <li><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> You, as the user, are solely responsible for ensuring that you have the legal right to convert and download any video content. We do not endorse or encourage unauthorized downloading or conversion of copyrighted materials.</li>
    <li><strong>No Affiliation:</strong> Our Extension is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by YouTube or any other video hosting platform.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our Extension is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:n1katuuun@gmail.com">n1katuuun@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:n1katuuun@gmail.com">n1katuuun@gmail.com</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Consent</h2>
  <p>By installing and using the Video to MP3 Extension, you consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>
